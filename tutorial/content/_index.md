# W3C Vehicle Information Signal Specification ver 2

This W3C specification, soon to become a W3C standard, is developed at the [W3C/automotive github](https://github.com/w3c/automotive),
and this Github contains a reference implementation in the form of a server that exposes an interface according to the specification.

Also found on this Github are implementations of other components that are needed to realize a communication tech stack, from clients to the underlying vehicle system.
These components can be categorized as follows:
* server
* client
* data storage
* feeder
